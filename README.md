# Dynamic-Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique used for solving complex problems by breaking them into simpler subproblems. 
It is particularly useful for optimization problems where the solution can be built from smaller overlapping solutions.

DP is applicable when a problem exhibits overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure:

* [Overlapping Subproblems: The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are solved multiple times.]
* [Optimal Substructure: The optimal solution of a problem can be derived from optimal solutions of its subproblems.]
